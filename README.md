EQS is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed specifically for QA teams to test software accessibility for users with various types of color blindness. It ensures that all visual elements in a program, whether a website, application, or game, remain accessible to individuals with color vision deficiencies.

Key Features:

Color Blindness Simulation: EQS simulates how individuals with different types of color blindness perceive the screen. It includes simulations for:

Deuteranomaly
Protanomaly
Protanopia
Deuteranopia
Tritanopia
Tritanomaly
Achromatopsia
Customizable Filters: Users can create custom filters tailored to their own specific color blindness needs, allowing them to adjust the display for optimal personal use.

Hotkey Binding for Runtime Use: EQS can be easily used during the runtime of a program with customizable hotkeys. This makes it simple to toggle between different color blindness simulations or adjust filter settings on the fly.

Screen Comparison with Print Screen Functionality: By pressing the Print Screen key, users can capture screenshots showing the normal view alongside the selected color blindness simulation. This allows for direct comparison to identify areas of concern.

Game & Runtime Application Testing: When testing dynamic environments such as games, EQS allows users to suspend the process in real-time. This feature enables users to pause at any point and thoroughly inspect areas that might be inaccessible or hard to view for color-blind individuals.

Adjustable Severity Levels: EQS provides the ability to shift the severity of color blindness, adjusting the wavelength (nM) to see at which point certain visual elements become difficult to distinguish. This feature helps determine the exact range where accessibility issues arise.

Scientifically-backed Accuracy: The color blindness matrixes within EQS are based on the publication "A Physiologically-based Model for Simulation of Color Vision Deficiency" by Gustavo M. Machado, Manuel M. Oliveira, and Leandro A. F. Fernandes, ensuring the simulations are scientifically accurate.

With EQS, QA teams can guarantee that software is visually accessible to a broader audience, including those with varying degrees of color vision deficiency, ultimately improving usability and inclusivity.
